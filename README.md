At the current time of creating this script, most roblox executors are patched, meaning you cannot use this script to exploit in any games at this current time. When Synpase X and KRNL are updated, you should be able to use this script whenever you feel like it.
Having problems with the script for some reason? This means your executor cannot run this script for some reason, but I doubt that will happen unless your executor is shit!
Having problems with the script for some reason? If you are using an executor such as Synpase X or KRNL yet still cant run this script, this means that this script is outdated, sorry!
